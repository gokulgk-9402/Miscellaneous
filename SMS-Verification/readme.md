# SMS-Verification

I have used [this site](https://www.fast2sms.com/dashboard/sms/bulk) for authenticating an user through an OTP message sent to their mobile number using the API of that website.
                       
This can be used as a part of an upgraded password manager, which doesn't need a master password, but this OTP for verificaiton. This can also be used as a part of user verification for websites.
