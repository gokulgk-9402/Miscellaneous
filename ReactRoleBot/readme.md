# Simple React role cog for Discord Bot (Python)

This is a simple cog for a discord bot, you can add it to the cogs folder of your discord bot's code if needed and replace the role emojis with your choices and role names also with your choices. You need the channel ID, message ID, server ID of the react role message for now. However, if you have anything similar to a database, only the channel ID for each server.

## Steps to run:
* Just include the file in your cogs, make the changes as required.
* Start your bot.
* Use the command <prefix>reactinit - to send the react role message, copy the message's id, message's channel id. (Or you can put in message id of any message that you want to be as react role message)
* Make necessary changes in the functions (Use server id, channel id, message id)
* Restart the bot and you are good to go.
