# Simple Email Authentication using OTP

This is a simple program that can generate an OTP and send it to your email and prompt you to enter it and check if it matches the one it generated.  

SMTP library is used to send the email. And a gmail account is used for the bot.  

To run the program, enter the email id and the password you get from google account settings in the data.json file, and run the main.py file.  

This can be used as a part of authentication for a website, for an application, for password manager, etc. This can also be improved by adding a time limit for one OTP to be valid, etc.
