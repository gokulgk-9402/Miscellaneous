# Sketch

Here I have created a simple application - sketch (similar to paint) using pygame. 
You can draw in black and white with 100 x 100 pixels. 
The pixel count can be increased by simple modifications in the code. 
When you want to save, you can press S on keyboard, and you will be prompted to enter a filename in a tkinter window and the image will be saved under the name specified.
If you press R, the whole screen will be reset.  

The screenshots, and an actual result of saving the image can be found in this folder.  

There are various use cases for this code and various improvements possible. Like adding colors, fill, etc.
