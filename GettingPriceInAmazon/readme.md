# Getting prize of an item in Amazon.in using simple web scraping  

This code can be used to check the availability, get its price, title if its available from amazon.in through webscraping using the python library beautifulsoup. This can be made part of a price tracker, price predictor, etc.  

This code will work only for **amazon.in** as the id's of various elements may differ in other sites.   

A picture of the product from the site and the output of my code are in this same directory.
