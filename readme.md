# Custom navigation bar in HTML using Bootstrap

[Click here to go to bootstrap website](https://getbootstrap.com/)

The starting template is got from Bootstrap's site:

This is just a simple custom navigation bar that I created for HTML using Bootstrap, which can be useful in other frontend projects that I will work on in the future.  

There are basic fields like icon, title, links to different pages, drop down menu (with optional divider), search field and search button.
